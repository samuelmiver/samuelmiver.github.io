### Research 

Samuel Miravet-​Verde is a computational biologist with expertise in microbiology and artificial intelligence-​based bioinformatic approaches to understand complex microbiological genomic and functional aspects. Throughout his PhD he led research to show that small proteins are as important as larger proteins in microbial systems, developing multiple tools to study them, as well as other problems such as assessing gene essentiality, and as main data-​analyst in several collaborative projects. He joined the Sunagawa lab as a postdoc in 2022 to work in the development of the Ocean Microbiome Database and projects deriving from this resource.
